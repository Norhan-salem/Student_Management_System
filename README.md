# Student_Management_System
This is my final project for the C/Embedded C training provided by GARRAIO in collaboration with Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University. The project is a student management system coded in C language and offers functionality such as adding a new student, modifying their data, viewing a certain student(s) data and deleting a student's data through a menu.

The information for a single student is stored in a .txt file "db.txt" file and is as follows:
• Student Name: A single string representing the student's first and last name
• Student ID: a 7-digit code that is unique for each student
• Student Gender: A single character representing the gender of the student ('M' or 'F')
• Academic Year: An integral number between 1 and FACULTY_MAX_ACADEMIC_YEAR 
• GPA: a positive floating-point value between 0 and 4.0
